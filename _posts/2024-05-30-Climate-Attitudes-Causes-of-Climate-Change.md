title: Climate Attitudes - Causes of Climate Change

An interactive map showing the share of people in each country who think that climate change is caused by humans, using ISSP 2020 survey data. <!--end_excerpt-->

This is mostly an attempt at embedding interactive graphs made with the `plotly` package for R. The result is not pretty (yet), but it works.

The data is still interesting, though. While climate change deniers are a relatively small group in most countries, not everyone who acknowledges climate change also thinks it is mostly caused by human activity. In fact, as shown below, it is mostly Northern and Western European nations where an absolute majority shares this belief. This illustrates the need to understand attitudes towards climate change as a spectrum, ranging from environmentalists to deniers, with degrees of belief and scepticism in between. 

Mouseover for percentages.
